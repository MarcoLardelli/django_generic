# django_generic

A demo Django web app based on generic views, templates etc..

You only have to write your model classes and Django will do **all** the rest for you! Ideal for simple CRUD apps or as a basis for your larger application.



A description of the code can be found on my blog:

https://lardel.li/2024/02/django-generic-views-app.html

The code needs the Django framework in version 5.0 with a supported python interpreter to run. Read the [installation instructions on the Django website](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/install/)

The included sqlite database contains a few (silly) demo data records and a demo user (username: demo, password: demo. **Change this before deploying your app**!). 

Also don't forget to change the SECRET_KEY variable in generic/settings.py!

Enjoy!
